Practice project made whilst following the tutorial made by freeCodeCamp.org. The video can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-42K44A1oMA. 
I used the video to help build my knowledge on full stack development, as well as help with problems I was facing on a private project i am yet to preview.
This project using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node).
